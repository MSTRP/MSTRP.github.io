        Thank your for your revenue retention request. Once you have submitted a completed declaration form, we will
        review your
        request internally and inform you in due course with Wellcome's decision. Please ensure that you insert full
        details and
        budget of how the funds will be used should Wellcome approve this
        application and how the activity/activities described will support new translational activities in line with
        Wellcome's charitable objectives to improve human health or will support equitable access to healthcare
        interventions. Wherever possible please include success metrics – you will be expected to report on whether
