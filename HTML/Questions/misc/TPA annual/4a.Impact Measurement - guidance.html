    <b>What does "engaged in translation" mean?</b><br />
    A researcher engaged in translational research will be undertaking applied research and related
    activities that are based on fundamental scientific and clinical discoveries, and that are intended to
    lead to a significant positive change for society, in which Wellcome’s interest is a meaningful
    improvement in healthcare. <br />
    <br />
    Evidence a researcher is engaged in translation may arrive from any of the following:
    <ul>
        <li><u>In receipt of translational funding (Wellcome or otherwise) </u></li>
        <li>They have NHS funding in addition to their Wellcome grant </li>
        <li>They have NIHR funding in addition to their Wellcome grant</li>
        <li>They have industry funding in addition to their Wellcome grant (excluding contract research
            or studentships)</li>
        <li>They have licensing/spin-out activity in addition to their Wellcome grant</li>
        <li>Actively engaging with translational infrastructure – TTO (for example, made an invention
            disclosure, filed a patent, discussions re licensing or collaboration agreements) or engaged
            with an entrepreneur in residence </li>
        <li>Translational publication (in the last 5 years)</li>
        <li>Patent filing (in the last 5 years) or active prosecution of an historic patent family</li>
    </ul>
    Please note this list is not exhaustive and indeed within a University ecosystem there may be other
    markers of engagement. However, for this analysis, consistency in the criteria employed at an
    institution is key. <br />
    <br />
    Self-reporting (for example <em>via</em> institutional surveys) is a useful tool for Universities to identify those
    researchers who are interested in translation, and where they are not already engaged in
    translation, assist them developing that programme or opportunity further. <br />
    <br />
    <b>Who is a "Wellcome researcher"?</b><br />
    A Wellcome researcher is anyone who is named on and in direct receipt (ie. PI, Co-PI) of Wellcome
    funding excluding those who have a Wellcome PhD studentship (including clinical research training
    fellowships), an equipment grant and anyone in receipt of funding from our Culture and Society
    funding schemes. With regards Wellcome Trust Centres, we ask that you only include the Centre
    Director rather than the individual group leaders – unless they have funding from Wellcome
    independently of the Centre award.
