        In May 2018 Wellcome simplified its standard revenue and equity share for projects governed by our&nbsp;standard
        Grant Conditions&nbsp;<span class="menuHelper helpText">(see menu&nbsp;<img

        adopting
        a flat rate 25% Wellcome share, with no technology transfer fee. Universities, research institutes and others
        holding grants under Wellcome’s standard Grant Conditions may use this new simpler approach&nbsp;<span

        may have

        Any award holder having entered into bespoke funding arrangements with Wellcome’s Innovations Team (i.e. not
        under
        our Standard Grant Conditions) and using this template to report their IP activities, should calculate revenue
        and
        equity as provided for by those bespoke arrangements, unless informed otherwise.<br>

        Your Organisation may apply each year to retain some or all of the revenue share due to Wellcome over the prior
        12-months. Requests to retain funds can only be made in order to fund new translational activities which support
        Wellcome's mission to improve human health, or to support equitable access to healthcare interventions. Wellcome
        will review the request and inform you of our decision. If Wellcome rejects your application (in whole or in
        part)
        we will issue an invoice for payment of our revenue share (or the relevant portion of it which remains due after
        any
        permitted revenue retention is deducted).
