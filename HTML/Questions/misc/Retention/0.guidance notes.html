    From 2018, Wellcome has allowed organisations to request to retain some, or all, of Wellcome's revenue share (if
    not already paid to Wellcome) to apply it to new translational activities or to support access to healthcare
    interventions. A condition of any such revenue retention is that you report on your use of the retained funds. As
    ${e://Field/organisation}&nbsp;was allowed to
    retain revenue in ${e://Field/Previous%20year}, please set out full details in this report of:

        <li><b>Section 1:</b> Any unspent amounts (to be returned to Wellcome);</li>
        <li><b>Section 2:</b> What the retained funds have been spent on;</li>
        <li><b>Section 2:</b> A confirmation that this spend matches the uses referred to when the request to retain the
            funds was
            originally made; and</li>
        <li><b>Section 3:</b> How the funded activities have supported translation or access to
            healthcare interventions, with reference to any success metrics given in your original
