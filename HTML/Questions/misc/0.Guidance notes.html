    <p>Unless agreed otherwise for particular awards, Wellcome requires annual reporting on IP and commercialisation efforts
        for all its awards relating to research - see our <a
            href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/grant-conditions" target="_blank"><strong>standard Grant
                Conditions</strong></a> at 4.7, together with our <a
            href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/policy-intellectual-property" target="_blank"><strong>policy
                on intellectual property</strong></a> and our <a
            href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/policy-consent-revenue-equity-sharing"
            target="_blank"><strong>policy on consent and revenue and equity sharing</strong></a>. This electronic
        template letter (with the relevant appendices) should be used annually to report to Wellcome collectively on all
        research awards (both currently active awards and historic awards for which Wellcome-funded IP is still in
        force).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This electronic template report&nbsp;is intended primarily for universities, research institutes and other such
        organisations (referred to collectively hereafter as &ldquo;organisations&rdquo;).&nbsp;Organisations should
        include all relevant matters arising from awards made by Wellcome&rsquo;s Innovations Team, as well as those
        made by Wellcome&rsquo;s Science Team.&nbsp; This is notwithstanding that many Innovations awards are made under
        bespoke agreements rather than our standard grant conditions.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Unless you have agreed a different reporting period with Wellcome, <u>you must submit your reports by the
                end of February each year</u><span class="helpText">*&nbsp;</span>in relation to the previous
        calendar year&rsquo;s activities.</p>

    <p>Personal information provided by you shall only be collected, stored and used by Wellcome to the extent that the
        law allows.&nbsp; Most commonly we will use it to analyse what Wellcome funds and how we fund it.&nbsp; See our
